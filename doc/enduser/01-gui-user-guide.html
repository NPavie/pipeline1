	<h2 id="pipeline">Daisy Pipeline Overview</h2>
	<p>The DAISY Pipeline is a <em>framework for XML- and DTB-related transformations</em>. As such, it can be employed in various contexts, relating to both content creation and distribution.</p>
	<p>The actual functionality within the DAISY Pipeline is provided by several collaborating organizations. Most contributions are open source, and reside at <a href="http://daisymfc.sf.net">the DAISY Pipeline Sourceforge project</a>.</p>	
	<h3><em>You can contribute!</em></h3>
	<p>The DAISY Pipeline fully depends on the spirit of sharing within the DAISY community. Remember: you can contribute to its future in many ways: by developing new functionality, by writing or reviewing documentation, by supplying feature requests, and by reporting bugs.</p>
	<p>If you want to contribute, contact any of the project participants, or send an email to <a href="markus.gylling[at-sign]tpb.se">markus.gylling[at-sign]tpb.se</a>.</p>
	<p>See also the <a href="#request">Making a feature request</a> and <a href="#bugs">Reporting a bug</a> sections below.</p>
					
	<h2 id="install">GUI Installation</h2>
	<p>If you read this document before having installed the Pipeline GUI, please refer to the <a href="./installation.html">Pipeline Installation Instructions</a>.</p>


	
	<h2 id="initial">First Launch</h2>
	<p>As you launch the Pipeline the first time, you should follow the links given in the welcome screen, and read the advice given there. In particular, you will want to visit the <a href="#prefDialog">Preferences Dialog</a> to set some information relating to temporary file storage, and the location of external executables. Read more about this in the <a href="installation.html#config">Installation document</a>.</p>



	<h2 id="perspView">On Perspectives and Views</h2>
	<p>The Pipeline Graphical User Interface (GUI) uses the terms <em>Perspective</em> and <em>View</em> to refer to different parts of the interface.</p>
	<p>A Perspective is more or less synonomous to a main window; this main window contains subsections, referred to as Views.</p>
	<p>The DAISY Pipeline GUI contains two Perspectives; the <a href="#jobsPersp">Job (main) Perspective</a>, and the <a href="#docsPersp">Documentation perspective</a>. The Job Perspective in its turn contains several views, which you can read more about below in the <a href="#jobsPersp">Jobs Perspective</a> section.</p>	

	<h3>Navigating between Perspectives and Views</h3>
	<p>There are several ways to navigate among the different Perspectives and Views.</p>
	<p>To switch between perspectives, select <kbd>Open Perspective</kbd> in the <kbd>Window</kbd> menu, and select the Perspective you wish to open.</p>
	<img alt="Selecting a Perspective in the Window menu" src="xxx"/>	
	<p>Alternatively, you can make use of the Perspective Icons in the top right corner of your current Perspective.</p>
	<img alt="The Perspective Icons" src="xxx"/>
	<br/>
	<p>To open or set focus on a certain view, select the view you want in the <kbd>Show View</kbd> in the <kbd>Window</kbd> menu.</p>
	<p>You can also cycle between the different Perspectives and Views by using the <kbd>Window</kbd> menus <kbd>Navigation</kbd> entry. The cycle command also has keyboard shortcuts.</p>




	<h2 id="terminology">On Scripts, Jobs and Transformers</h2>
	<p>The three terms <em>Script</em>, <em>Job</em> and <em>Transformer</em> are central to understanding how the DAISY Pipeline works.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Script</dt>
		<dd>Scrips are used to drive the DAISY Pipeline. A script encapsulates a series of operations that are applied to the input data.<br/>
		The DAISY Pipeline ships with a series of predefined Scripts; in addition, advanced users can create their own Scripts with refinements and/or variations on the predefined Scripts.<br/>
		Documentation for the predefined Scripts exist in the <a href="#docsPersp">Documentatiton Perspective</a>.<br/>
		Information on how to create your own Script is currently beyond the scope of this guide.
		</dd>

		<dt>Job</dt>
		<dd>When you have selected a script to run, assigned what input data the script should use, configured details of the scripts behavior, and selected where the output should be placed, you have created a <em>Job</em>.</dd>

		<dt>Transformer</dt>
		<dd>Each Script contains one or several Transformers that are applied in sequence on the input data. When a Job is being run, you can see which Transformers are actually used in the <a href="#jobsPerspProgressView">Progress View</a>.<br/>
		Understanding how Transformers work is really only needed when you are creating your own Scripts. If you are happy and content with the predefined scripts, you need not worry about Transformers.
		</dd>
	</dl>

			
	<h2 id="jobsPersp">The Jobs Perspective</h2>					
	<h3 id="jobsPerspOverview">Jobs Perspective Overview</h3>					
	<p>The Jobs Perspective is the main window of the DAISY Pipeline GUI. Here, you configure and add jobs, run them, and monitor the progress.</p>
		
	<h3 id="jobsPerspJobQueue">The Jobs View</h3>
	<p>The Jobs View can be thought of as a Job <em>queue</em>. Each Job added is available as an entry in this view. You can expand the Job to review details of the job configuration.</p>
	<img alt="Close-up of a Job item in the Jobs View, the item is expanded showing configuration details" src="xxx"/>
	<p>Depending on the state of a job, the <em>status column</em> of the Jobs view will flag the status as IDLE, RUNNING, COMPLETED, or FAILED.</p>
	<p>If you are creating a queue of Jobs, you can reorder the queue via the arrow buttons in the top right corner of the Jobs view.</p>
	
	<h4 id="runJob">Running and cancelling jobs</h4>
	<p>The <kbd>Run</kbd> menu item contains entries for running <em>all</em> or the <em>currently selected</em> job. The same applies to the cancel command.</p>
	<p>You can also use the Run and Cancel buttons at the top right part of the Jobs View.</p>
	<img alt="The Run button at the top left part of the Jobs View" src="xxx" />
		
	<h3 id="jobsPerspNewJobWizard">The New Job Wizard</h3>
	<p>Jobs are added through a <em>Wizard</em>. The wizard is made up of a two-step process; first, select which Script you want to run, and then configure the Script parameters.</p>
	
	<p>The New Job Wizard can be launched either by selecting the <kbd>New... Pipeline Job</kbd> item in the <kbd>File</kbd> menu, or by pressing the Wizard button at the top left part of the Jobs View.</p>
	<img alt="The New Job Wizard button at the top left part of the Jobs View" src="xxx" />


	<h4>Wizard page 1: Select script</h4>
	<p class="notice">If you are not acquainted with the Scripts provided and the functionality they offer, it is recommended that you first spend some time browsing the Script documentation in the <a href="#docsPersp">Documentation Perspective</a>.</p>
	
	<p>The first page of the Wizard provides a tree view of the available scripts. As you select a script, a tooltip (also provided in the top bar of the page) will give a brief description of the Script functionality.</p> 
	<p>As you have found the script you intend to run, press the <kbd>next</kbd> button.</p>
	<img alt="The Job Wizard Script selector page, with a script selected" src="xxx" />

	<h4>Wizard page 2: configure script</h4>
	<p>The second page of the wizard contains all configuration options. The options are shown in two groups: <em>Required parameters</em> (needed for the script to be runnable), and <em>optional parameters</em> (that can be set if needed, but the script will run even if they are not explicitly set). Optional parameters often have <em>default values</em> that should work fine under normal circumstances.</p>
	<p>As you select a parameter, a tooltip (also provided in the top bar of the page) will give a brief description of the parameters meaning. If this information does not suffice, please refer to the Script documentation in the <a href="#docsPersp">Documentation Perspective</a>.</p> 	
	<img alt="The Job Wizard Script configuration page, with a parameter selected" src="xxx" />
	
	<p>Once all required parameters have been set, the <kbd>Finish</kbd> will become enabled. Press <kbd>Finish</kbd> to finalize the Wizard and return to the Jobs view. The Job has now been added to the Jobs queue. To run the job, use the <a href="#runJob">run command</a>.</p>


	
	<h3 id="jobsPerspProgressView">The Progress View</h3>
	<p>While a job is running, you can monitor the progress in the Progress View. The Progress View contains one entry for each Transformer that the script contains.</p>
	<img alt="The progress view while a Script is running" src="xxx" />

	<h3 id="jobsPerspMessagesView">The Messages View</h3>
	<p>The messages view will list all messages that are emitted by the DAISY Pipeline while running Jobs. Some of these messages are informational only (the Pipeline telling you that everything is going fine so far), whereas others are of critical importance to take part of. For example, if a job fails, the reason for the failure will be available here. Similarly, when a Job includes <em>validation</em>, the result of the validation will be reported here.</p>
	<p>The messages are of four main types.</p>
	<dl id="messageType">
		<dt>INFO</dt>
		<dd>This message type is informational; giving you progress and context information.</dd>
		<dt>WARNING</dt>
		<dd>This message type indicates that a possibly problematic event has occured; the Job may complete as intended, but extra caution should be taken to assure the result is OK.</dd>
		<dt>ERROR</dt>
		<dd>This message type indicates that an error has occured that either caused the Job to abort prematurely, or caused the output to be erroneous or incomplete.</dd>
		<dt>DEBUG</dt>
		<dd>This message type is for running the Pipeline in Debug mode, something which you may be asked to do if you encounter a bug, and the developer or support technician requests more information. Note that this message type is <a href="filterMessage">filtered out</a> by default, meaning that in order to see these messages, you need to turn off the DEBUG message filter.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>The message type is listed for each message in the right column of the Messages table view.</p>

	<h4 id="filterMessage">Filtering and grouping messages</h4>
	<p>Messages can be filtered (meaning: to show or not to show messages of a certain <a href="#messageType">type</a>). Messages can also grouped by type and per Job.</p>
	<p>The filtering and grouping options are available in the right top corner of the Messages View. There is a dedicated icon for filtering each message type. You can also access this functionailty via the Message View menu (appearing as a downwards white traingle icon).</p>
	<img alt="the filtering and grouping options dialog" src="xxx" />
	
	<h4 id="storeMessage">Storing messages</h4>
	<p>By selecting the <kbd>export messages</kbd> option in the top right corner of the Messages View, you can store message to a log file.</p>
	<img alt="the export messages button" src="xxx" />
	
	
	<h3 id="jobsPerspErrorLog">The Error Log</h3>
	<p>The Error Log is not shown by default. To show it, select <kbd>Show View...</kbd>, <kbd>Error Log</kbd> from the <kbd>Window</kbd> menu item.</p>
	<p>Under normal circumstances, you will not need to engage in the information in the Error Log. The information here is mainly intended for developers trying to fix a bug, or systems administrators trying to solve a problem.</p>
																											
	<h2 id="docsPersp">The Documentation Perspective</h2>
	<p>The documentation perspective contains three different categories of documents:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Help</dt>
		<dd>General help documents; installation, configuration etc.</dd>	

		<dt>Scripts</dt>
		<dd>Documentation on each one of the preperaded Scripts that ship with the default install of the DAISY Pipeline. If your installation contains custom (home-made) Scripts, documentation for it may or may not be available here.</dd>	

		<dt>Transformers</dt>
		<dd>Documentation on Transformers (which are what the scripts actually use to do their job). Transformer dcoumentation is primarily developer oriented. If you are not creating your own script, you probably will not need to read the documents in this category.</dd>
	</dl>
	<img alt="The three document category tabs in the Documentation Perspective" src="xxx" />
	<p>As you select a document in one of the tabs in the documentation tree view, the document will load in the browser window in the right part of the screen.</p>


	<h2 id="prefDialog">The Preferences Dialog</h2>
	<p>The Preferences Dialog can be accessed via the <kbd>Preferences</kbd> entry in the <kbd>Window</kbd> menu item.</p>
	<p>This dialog contains various settings for configuring the appearance of the GUI. You can also modify keyboard shortcuts here.</p>
	<p>The most important part of this dialog is the <em>Paths</em> section. You can read about what the different entries here	mean in the <a href="installation.html#config">Installation document</a>.</p>
	<img alt="The Paths section of the preferences dialog" src="xxx" />
