********************************
Version/Date: 2006-10-17

This is the ????????  release of DMFC.
Below three sections: Resolved issues from the FPA, Known Issues, and
Pending Features.

** Resolved issues from the FPA **

#1543841 - Resolved
  Running the RTF-to-Dtbook script more than once 
  during one session will make the application freeze.
  The transformer was changed to call python directly, instead of using
  jython, a java-python bridge.  This allows the RTF-to-DTBook script
  to run more than once.
  
#licenseinfo - Resolved
  The GUI does not yet provide information on specific licensing
  for specific scripts&transformers. 
  A Software User Agreement for both the DMFC and GUI enumerates
  specific licensing for all transformers.  The Software Agreement 
  must be accepted prior to installation of the program. 
  
#installer - Resolved
  Running the windows installer as non admin makes it impossible to
  uninstall using the uninstaller. 
  The windows installer may be run by admin or non-admin users,
  and the uninstaller works for both user types.
