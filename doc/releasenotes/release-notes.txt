This is the First Public Access (FPA) release of DMFC.
Below two sections: Known Issues and Pending Features

** Known Issues **
Below issues are already identified and marked for fixing til next release:

#1543841 
  Running the RTF-to-Dtbook script more than once 
  during one session will make the application freeze.
  The cause of the issue is known (#1543841) and 
  will be fixed by next release.

#1543978
  Running the int_daisy_unicodeTranscoder transformer
  with output encoding set to other than utf-8 or utf-16
  produces incorrect representation of certain 
  characters. The cause of the issue is known (#1543978) and 
  will be fixed by next release.

#licenseinfo 
  The GUI does not yet provide information on specific licensing
  for specific scripts&transformers.

#installer 
  Running the windows installer as non admin makes it impossible to
  uninstall using the uninstaller. Workaround is to delete the install
  directory, and the link on the start menu.

** Pending features **
Below features are not yet implemented, but high on the list for the next release:
- Access to transformer documentation from the GUI
- Specific licensing information when using particular 3d party libraries.

********************************
Version/Date: 2006-10-17

This is the second release of DAISY Pipeline.  Some notable 
updates to the software is listed below:

#Licensing

Software User Agreements for the DAISY Pipeline(both the DMFC and the GUI)
provide specific licensing information regarding 3rd party software. As in all 
agreements, it is the obligation of the user to read and accept all such terms 
and conditions of all third party software packages prior to the use of the 
DAISY Pipeline.


#WordML2DTBook
Version 1.4.1 (10 October 2006)
 
The most significant new feature in this release is that the converter 
now extracts images embedded in Word documents. Other enhancements include:
 
* Automatic frontmatter creation - everything preceding the first heading 
  will be part of the frontmatter.
* Attributes - several attributes have been added or changed.
* Customization - two new input parameters have been added: 'stylesheet' 
  and 'images'.
* Footnotes - The numbering of native footnotes have been improved

See the documentation for further information.

#rtf2dtbook
Version 1.1 (13 October 2006)

The converter uses command-line python and not jython (the java-python bridge) 
to complete the rtf-to-xml transformation. The switch has increased the speed 
and reliablity of the transformer.  In particular:

*  The rtf-to-dtbook transformer may be run more than once/session (resolution of issue #1543841)
*  The installation of the DAISY Pipeline does not terminate without notice (resolution of issue #1551549  )
*  The rtf-to-dtbook transformer using python performs at many times the speed of the same 
   transformer using jython.

#Java Virtual Machine parameters
The default heap size is set to 128 MB (-Xms128m -Xmx128m). To set it to
a different value, create a file named params.cfg in the installation 
directory containing a single line describing any parameters that should 
be sent to the Java virtual machine.

** Resolved issues from the FPA Release**

#1543841 - Resolved
  Running the RTF-to-Dtbook script more than once 
  during one session will make the application freeze.
  The transformer was changed to call python directly, instead of using
  jython, a java-python bridge.  This allows the RTF-to-DTBook script
  to run more than once.
  
#licenseinfo - Resolved
  The GUI does not yet provide information on specific licensing
  for specific scripts&transformers. 
  A Software User Agreement for both the DMFC and GUI enumerates
  specific licensing for all transformers.  The Software Agreement 
  must be accepted prior to installation of the program. 
  
#installer - Resolved
  Running the windows installer as non admin makes it impossible to
  uninstall using the uninstaller. 
  The windows installer may be run by admin or non-admin users,
  and the uninstaller works for both user types.
