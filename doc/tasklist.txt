joblist	 	GUI -Each job handles own msgs
			Ability to 2x click in job list
			for a list of msgs for that job		LS
			
freezejobs	GUI -how to handle completed jobs 
			in queue.  Freeze? View but take
			out of queue?						LE & LS

prgreports 	GUI The progress bar, elapsed time 
		    and estimmated time describe the
		    progress of the *current 
		    transformer*, not the current job. 
		    What would be really nice is a 
		    progress bar alongside each 
		    transformer name in the 
		    "Transformers in Conversion" list. 
		    That would give a nice visual 
		    overview of the conversion process. 
		    Also, when a job is finished, it 
		    would be cool if the gui would 
		    report the running time of that 
		    job in the job queue.				LE & LS
