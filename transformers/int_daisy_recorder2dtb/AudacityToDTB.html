<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
This script creates a DAISY/NISO NCX-Only DTB from an Audacity project. By using markers in a predefined 
way while recording audio in Audacity, the resulting DTB can contain headings, pagenumbers, producer notes and sidebars.</p>
<p>A special technique (described below) also allows the pagenumbers, producer notes and sidebars to become skippable in th eoutput DTB.</p>

<h2 id="inputReqs">Input Requirements</h2>
<p>An Audacity project file (*.aup), following the DTB-enabling conventions as described in the section below.</p>

<h3>Using Audacity to create an NCX-Only DTB</h3>

<p>For each wave track in Audacity, there must be a label track immediately below.</p> 
<p>You can record your project using one wavetrack only, or you can use several wavetracks, as long as all wavetracks have a label track immediately below.</p>
<h4>Creating headings</h4>
<p>For each heading you want create, drop a Marker. The markers value must begin with h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, or h6 for the marker to be detected as a heading.</p>
<p>The text following in the marker value will become the heading text. For example a marker value of <code>h2 Introduction to Marxism</code> will create a level 2 heading with the title "Introduction to Marxism".</p>

<h4>Creating pages</h4>
<p>For each page you want create, drop a Marker. The markers value must begin with p for the marker to be detected as a pagenumber.</p>
<p>For example, the marker value "p56" will create a normal pagenumber with the value "56". 
You can also create special and front pages; the marker value <code>pIV</code will create a front page with the roman numeral four. The marker value <code>pA23</code> will create a page-special with the value A23.</p>
<br/>
<p>You can also have pagenumbers be autonumbered during the DTB generation. Simply create a marker with the value <code>p</code> and then activate the autonumbering feature of this script. Note - if you active page renumbering, all normal pages will be renumbered, even those that were actually given a value in the Marker value field.</p>


<h4>Creating producer notes</h4>
<p>For each producer note you want create, drop a Marker. The markers value must begin with <code>prodnote</code> for the marker to be detected as a producer note.</p>

<h4>Creating sidebars</h4>
<p>For each producer note you want create, drop a Marker. The markers value must begin with <code>sidebar</code> for the marker to be detected as a sidebar.</p>

<h4 id="durMarkers"><em>Use markers with duration if you can!</em></h4>
<p>By creating markers that have a duration (i.e. a start and an end point), you allow constructs to become skippable.</p>
<p>For a maximum quality output DTB, adopt this technique in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create markers that spans each heading announcement</p>
<li>Create markers that spans each page number announcement</p>
<li>Create markers that spans each sidebar (the entire sidebar, not just the sidebar title announcement</p>
<li>Create markers that spans each producer note (the entire producer note, not just the producer note title announcement</p>
</ul>

<h4>Title and Author</h4>
<p>This script will assume that the reading of the documents title will be the first phrase of the recording, and that the documents author will be the second phrase.</p>

<h4>Metadata</h4>

<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>A DAISY/NISO (ANSI/NISO Z3986-2005) NCX-Only DTB that can contain headings, pages, producer notes and sidebars. The three latter are skippable if <a href="#durMarkers">markers with duration</a> are used.</p>


<h2 id="config">Configuration</h2>
	<dl id="paramslist">
		<dt>Input file</dt>
		<dd><strong>Required.</strong> The input Audacity project file (*.aup)</dd>
	
		<dt>Output directory</dt>
		<dd><strong>Required.</strong> The directory to store the output in. This <em>can</em> be set as the same as the input directory, but it is recommended to use another directory than the input directory.</dd>
