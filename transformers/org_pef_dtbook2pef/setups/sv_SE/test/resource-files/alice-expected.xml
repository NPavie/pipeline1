<row/>
<row>Alice was beginning to get very</row>
<row>tired of sitting by her sister</row>
<row>on the bank, and of having</row>
<row>nothing to do: once or twice she</row>
<row>had peeped into the book her</row>
<row>sister was reading, but it had</row>
<row>no pictures or conversations in</row>
<row>it, 'and what is the use of a</row>
<row>book,' thought Alice 'without</row>
<row>pictures or conversation?'</row>
<row>  So she was considering in her</row>
<row>own mind (as well as she could,</row>
<row>for the hot day made her feel</row>
<row>very sleepy and stupid), whether</row>
<row>the pleasure of making a daisy-</row>
<row>chain would be worth the trouble</row>
<row>of getting up and picking the</row>
<row>daisies, when suddenly a White</row>
<row>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close</row>
<row>by her.</row>
<row>  There was nothing so VERY</row>
<row>remarkable in that; nor did</row>
<row>Alice think it so VERY much out</row>

<row>Chapter 1   2011-01-11    Page 2</row>
<row>of the way to hear the Rabbit</row>
<row>say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh</row>
<row>dear! I shall be late!' (when</row>
<row>she thought it over afterwards,</row>
<row>it occurred to her that she</row>
<row>ought to have wondered at this,</row>
<row>but at the time it all seemed</row>
<row>quite natural); but when the</row>
<row>Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT</row>
<row>OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and</row>
<row>looked at it, and then hurried</row>
<row>on, Alice started to her feet,</row>
<row>for it flashed across her mind</row>
<row>that she had never before seen a</row>
<row>rabbit with either a waistcoat-</row>
<row>pocket, or a watch to take out</row>
<row>of it, and burning with</row>
<row>curiosity, she ran across the</row>
<row>field after it, and fortunately</row>
<row>was just in time to see it pop</row>
<row>down a large rabbit-hole under</row>
<row>the hedge.</row>
