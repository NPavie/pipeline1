		<h1>WordML2DTBook as of November 21, 2005</h1>
		<h2>General assumptions</h2>
		<p>The text must be contained in a single flow. The converter has not been designed for nor tested 
		with anchored or free floating objects.</p>
		<h2>List of addressed objects:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Paragraph styles</li>
			<li>Character styles</li>
			<li>Lists</li>
			<li>Tables</li>
			<li>Footnotes</li>
			<li>Images</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Objects not in this list are ignored, e.g. page breaks, cross references...</p>
		<h2>Paragraph and character styles</h2>
		<h3>Paragraph styles</h3>
		<p>The WordML2DTBook transform will recognize the following built-in paragraph formats:</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr><th>name</th><th>action</th></tr>
			<tr><td>heading 1</td><td>h1</td></tr>
			<tr><td>heading 2</td><td>h2</td></tr>
			<tr><td>heading 3</td><td>h3</td></tr>
			<tr><td>heading 4</td><td>h4</td></tr>
			<tr><td>heading 5</td><td>h5</td></tr>
			<tr><td>heading 6</td><td>h6</td></tr>
			<tr><td>footnote text</td><td>a block of consecutive paragraphs with footnote text is wrapped in a note-tag and each paragraph is wrapped in a p-tag</td></tr>
			<tr><td>block text</td><td>a block of consecutive paragraphs with block text is wrapped in a blockquote-tag and each paragraph is wrapped in a p-tag</td></tr>
			<tr><td>annotation text</td><td>the content is commented out</td></tr>
		</table>
		<h3>Character styles</h3>
		<p>The WordML2DTBook transform will recognize the following built-in character formats:</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr><th>name</th><th>action</th></tr>
			<tr><td>strong</td><td>strong</td></tr>
			<tr><td>emphasis</td><td>em</td></tr>
			<tr><td>page number</td><td>pagenum</td></tr>
			<tr><td>footnote reference</td><td>noteref</td></tr>
		</table>
		<h3>Customizing</h3>
		<p>Additional styles can be defined using the custom section of the "mappings" tag
		set. It has been suggested that this section should be separated from the xslt.</p>
		<h2>Structure</h2>
		<p>WordML contains wrapper elements that closely matches the levelx tagging, which consequently are converted into levelx tags.</p>
		<h2>Lists</h2>
		<p>List paragraphs are converted into lists of type pl and the list item symbol is kept as contents.</p>
		<p>Hierarchical lists will be flattened.</p>
		<h2>Tables</h2>
		<p>Tables are converted, but row spanning can't be used.</p>
		<h2>Footnotes</h2>
		<p>By using standard footnotes i Word, the link between note and reference is preserved. If this is
		not an option, it is possible to use the "footnote reference" character style and the "footnote text" 
		paragraph style. However, a link between the two is not created using this method.</p>
		<h2>Images</h2>
		<p>An imagegroup and an img tag is created for an image, but the image is not extracted (this is beyond
		the limitations of XSLT 1.0 anyway).</p>
		<h2>Formatting</h2>
		<p>No formatting is taken into account in this transform, thus e.g. bold or italic is <em>not</em>
		converted. Bold or italics that should be retained must be tagged using the strong or emphasis character style, respectively.</p>
		<h2>Future improvements</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Auto connect footnotes that were created using styles.</li>
			<li>Handle hierarchical lists</li>
			<li>Moving the customizable part out of the xslt</li>
		</ul>
